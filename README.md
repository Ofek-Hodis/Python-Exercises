# Python-Exercises
A repository created for practice exercises that are not part of a big project, to help me track my progress.

## Binary Search
A search method that efficiently finds the position of a target value in a **sorted** array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.<br>
It's complexity is \(O(\log n)\).<br>

Also created a recursive binary search function.<br>
This code helped me better understand divide-and-conquer thinking and practice basic Big O notation.

## Interpolation search
A search method that improves on binary search for **sorted (best for uniformly distributed)** arrays by estimating target location, instead of always checking the middle. <br>

This code helped me practice reasoning about index formulas, and compare its behavior to binary search in different input cases.
